- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

1. **Add TODOAPP:** `POST /api/TODOAPP`
2. **Get All TODOAPP:** `GET /all/TODOAPP`
3. **Get TODOAPP by ID:** `GET /api/TODOAPP/{id}/detail`
4. **Update TODOAPP :** `PUT /user/api/TODOAPP/{id}/number/`
5. **Delete TODOAPP by ID:** `DELETE /api/TODOAPP/{id}/id`

## Database Design

The project's database design includes tables for user management, with fields such as:

- `todoId` (User ID)
- `todoName` (User Name)
- `name` (name)
- `todoDate` (Todo date)

### ArrayList

The project utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to store and manage lists of `TODOAPP` objects in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing user records and performing operations on them.

These data structures enable the application to organize and manipulate user data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.
